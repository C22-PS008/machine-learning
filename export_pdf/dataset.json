    "summary":"Essentially, a data scientist is someone who gathers and analyzes with the goal of reaching a conclusion. They do this through a variety of techniques. They may present the data in a visual context, or, data visualization, observing clear data patterns that wouldnt be noticeable if the information was presented in hard numbers on a spreadsheet. Data scientists often create highly advanced algorithms that are used to determine patterns, take the data from a jumble of numbers and stats, and derive what can be useful for a business or organization. At its core, data science is the practice of looking for meaning in mass amounts of data."
